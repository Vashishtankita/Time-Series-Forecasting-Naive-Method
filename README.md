# Time Series Forecasting using Naive Method

This project demonstrates time series forecasting using the Naive method, implemented in Python with Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Overview

The Naive method is a simple forecasting technique that assumes the next value in a time series will be the same as the last observed value. This project explores:

- Loading and preprocessing time series data
- Implementing the Naive forecasting method
- Evaluating forecast accuracy using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
- Visualizing the results

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for evaluation metrics

## Future Improvements

- Implement more advanced forecasting methods for comparison
- Experiment with different datasets
- Add interactive visualizations
